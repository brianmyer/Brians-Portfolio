## Description 

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is a landing page which houses recent an About Me section, recent projects to show samples of work, and a Contact section allowing the user to contact the developer through email, telephone, or LinkedIn. There is also a link in the Contact section to Github repositories that correspond to the displayed projects.

### Refactoring code

 This updated code adds semantic HTML elements to provide more structure to the webpage and give the browser more information on each of the sections. It also consolidates classes using identical styling in order to simplify the CSS page.

 ### Accessibility

 A unique title has been added to the head to increase SEO. Alt attributes are also added to all images for a higher standard of accessibility.

 ## Installation

 N/A

 ## Usage

 This challenge is meant for practice in specifying sections of code where possible with semantic HTML, simplifying and consolidating repeated sections, and adding a title and descriptions to images.
